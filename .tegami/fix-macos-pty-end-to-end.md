## Fix macOS reconnect and PTY end-to-end failures

Fix the remaining macOS portability failures in reconnect, terminal shutdown,
and background process-group cleanup.

The terminal launcher now resolves busybox-style symlinks before re-exec,
client and router loops detect Darwin socket closure reliably, and the PTY
fixtures no longer depend on interactive-shell timing. macOS CI now runs the
affected reconnect and PTY/process integration tests explicitly.
