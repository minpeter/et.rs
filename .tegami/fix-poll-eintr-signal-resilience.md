## Fix client dying with "polling terminal streams: Interrupted system call (os error 4)"

The client installs a process-wide SIGWINCH handler for terminal resizes, and
`poll()` is never auto-restarted by `SA_RESTART`: any signal delivered to the
thread blocked in `poll()` (a window resize, `SIGCONT` after job control,
`SIGINFO` from Ctrl-T on macOS) made it fail with `EINTR`, which the client
treated as fatal and tore the session down mid-use.

The terminal loop now retries `poll()` on `EINTR`, recomputing the keepalive
timeout from the absolute deadline so timing stays correct. The same retry was
applied to every other interruptible `poll()` in the workspace: the server
session bridge, the PTY worker, the jump-host bridge, and the port-forward
acceptor (which previously exited silently on `EINTR`).
